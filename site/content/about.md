The St. Augustine Music Project is a no-nonsense, distraction-free way to find out about upcoming shows and events in St. Augustine, FL. It was launched in May 2017 as a response to the gravitational pull of Facebook as a way to promote events. The time-honored tradition of designing a flyer, making copies of it, and hanging them up around all the cool places in town has largely been abandoned. I created this site as an open source, advertisement-free alternative to that.
