Hello, and welcome to the St. Augustine Music Project website. This was created in the summer of 2017 as a way to document, and give exposure to, the wonderful music scene located in the country’s oldest city. Musicians here have a very healthy do-it-yourself attitude, and this project is no exception. It was developed right here in downtown St. Augustine, and contains no tracking software, advertisements, or any other horrors that sites like Facebook and Instagram thrive on.

The project is still in its very early stages, so please bookmark us and check back often. If you’re interested in helping out, please check out the [about](/about/) section to learn more.
